<h1>CS107</h1>

CS107 is the **Programming Paradigms** Course offered by Stanford and taught  by Professor Jerry Cain.  This course includes fundamentals of C language, how it is compiled to assembly language, how the memory works, how pointers work and much more.
This Repo will contain important notes from the lecture videos which can be helpful while following along the course. These notes are in no way a replacement for the actual lectures.


<h2>Lecture 02</h2>

> How bit pattern is interpreted if the variable type is changed. It also covers, sign extention, representation of float in memory and signed representation of integer in memory

<h2>Lecture 03</h2>

> How pointer arithmetic works. How to access out of bound regions using pointer arithmetic. How structures and arrays are laid in the memory.

<h2>Lecture 09</h2>

> How does the C code look after getting translated in to Assemly language.

<h2>Lecture 10</h2>

> How the Activation Record is populated in stack, how memory is allocated at the start of the function call and de-allocated at the end of the function call.

<h2>Lecture 11</h2>

> How C and C++ codes are similar after compilation
